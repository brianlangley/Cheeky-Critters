# Project Transfer Document Cheeky Critters

## Dear Colleague

Here are the main refinement items and tasks for the Cheeky Critters project to ensure a smooth handover and continued development.

### Big Ticket Refinement Items

#### 1. Structure Generation and Collision Responses
**Description:** Improve the current implementation of the structure generation and ensure realistic collision responses using Matter.js.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Integrate Matter.js into the project.
- [ ] Redefine the structure generation logic to use Matter.js for better physics handling.
- [ ] Ensure realistic collision reactions when projectiles hit structures.

#### 2. Score Rendering Issue
**Description:** Fix the issue where the score is not rendering correctly on the screen.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Debug and identify why the score is not displaying.
- [ ] Implement a solution to render the score correctly on the game screen.
- [ ] Ensure the scoring system updates in real-time with each action.

#### 3. Optimise Game Performance
**Description:** Enhance the overall performance of the game to ensure smooth gameplay.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Profile the game to identify performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Optimise rendering and asset loading.
- [ ] Implement efficient memory management practices.

#### 4. Finalise and refune Game Features
**Description:** Complete and refine all game features to ensure a polished final product.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Ensure all character animations and states are fully implemented and working.
- [ ] Refine enemy spawning logic and difficulty levels.
- [ ] Add and refine sound effects and particle effects.
- [ ] Conduct extensive playtesting and debugging to identify and fix any remaining issues.

#### 5. Documentation and Deployment
**Description:** Finalise project documentation and set up deployment for easy access.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Complete the project documentation, including a user manual and developer guide.
- [ ] Ensure the deployment process is well-documented and easy to follow.
