- [ ] Redefine the structure generation logic to use Matter.js for better physics handling.
- [ ] Ensure realistic collision reactions when projectiles hit structures.

#### 2. Score Rendering Issue
**Description:** Fix the issue where the score is not rendering correctly on the screen.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Debug and identify why the score is not displaying.
- [ ] Implement a solution to render the score correctly on the game screen.
- [ ] Ensure the scoring system updates in real-time with each action.

#### 3. Implement Level System
**Description:** Design and implement a level progression system to enhance gameplay and player engagement.

**Task List:**
- [ ] Design a scalable level system with increasing difficulty.
- [ ] Implement level transitions.
- [ ] Ensure each level introduces new challenges and rewards.

#### 4. Finalise and Refine Game Features
**Description:** Complete and refine all game features to ensure a polished final product.

**Task List:**
